# pig-game
My first game, a basic pig game (a dice game basically in which you have the chance to hold the score, but if you get 1, your currents core resets) and the player to reach 100 points wins first, learnt a lot of class handling in this game specially active and winner, also learnt about state variables and creating a new game
